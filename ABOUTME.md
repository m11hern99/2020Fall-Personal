My name is Maria Hernandez and I am majoring in Computer Science. Most of the courses I’ve taken on computer science have all been through this campus at SUNY New Paltz. I’ve currently only taken Computer Science 1 and 2 and this semester I’m taking Computer Science 3, Object Oriented Programming and Assembly Language and Computer Architecture. Though I don’t have any programs or projects I’ve worked on yet, I am hoping to use what I’ve learned in this course for future smaller projects like helping friends and family members with their businesses by creating interactive websites.
